# Operators

In yasos we have some operator to math or logic operations.

## Math

We have '+' to add, '-' to substact, astherisc to multiply and / to divide.
Not only do we have this simple operators but also we use some to use with variables: += to add to the variable, -= to substract, astherisc and = to multiply and /= to divide.

We sometimes use inc (name) and dec (name) to increment or decrement in 1 the variable's value > This only works in integer variables

## Logical

We usually use them to make comparations.

v1 < v2 (if v1 is less)
v1 <= v2 (if v1 is less or equal)
v1 > v2 (if v1 is greater)
v1 >= v2 (if v1 is greater or equal)
v1 == v2 (if v1 is equal)
v1 != v2 (is v1 is not equal)

# Unary
We sometimes use unary operators, these only can be used with one value

!value (give the inverse value)
value!! (give tha factorial of the integer value)
