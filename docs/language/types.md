# Data types

Yasos is a static typed language, this means you have to declarate the type of variables and parameters.

## Types
- Integer: numeric value with no decimals (int)
- Double: numeric value with decimals (double)
- String: text value (str)
- Struct value: represents a structure

> We do not have boolean value, we have to use an integer, but we can atleast use true and false as values

> NOTE: yasos can not make automatically conversions between integers and doubles
