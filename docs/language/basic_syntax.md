# Basic syntax

In yasos we use a syntax similar to C++ and Rust.

- For the declaration of functions and statments we use the {} and we do not care about identation.

- Each instruction must finish in a ;

- It is recommended, but no obligatory to name your variable and function with the sneak_nomination (Ex: title_label)
