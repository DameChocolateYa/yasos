# Loops

We use the loops to repeat a code while a condition is true.

## While

Used for normal conditions:
`while x < 3 {
    x += 1;
}
`

## For

Used when we declare the variable in the loop:
`
for var x: int = 3; x < 10; inc x {
    code...
}
`

For loop is composed by an initiation, a condition and a final statment.

## Loop

We use it to repeat a code without an explicit condition
`
loop {
    code...
}
`

## Stop and continue

We use the instruction stop when we do not want to keep itinerating in the loop.
We use the instruction continue when we want no go to the init of the loop's code
